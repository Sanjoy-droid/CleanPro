# 🔍 Google Search Strings to Hunt “No Website” Ops

Copy/paste + swap `[NICHE]` & `[CITY]`:

- `site:facebook.com "[NICHE]" "[CITY]"` → pulls only FB biz pages.
- `"[NICHE]" "[CITY]" -site:*.com -site:*.net -site:*.org` → filters out proper websites.
- `"[NICHE]" "[CITY]" "call" "text"` → finds phone-only ads.
- `"24/7 [NICHE]" "[CITY]" "Facebook"` → emergency ops that only post on FB.
- `"[CITY] [NICHE]" "Google Maps"` → check if they only run off GBP.
